### **Renewable Energy Project: Pavegen Electricity**  

Our project focuses on designing and developing **piezoelectric sidewalk panels** to harness renewable energy from urban environments. By leveraging the piezoelectric effect, we aim to convert the mechanical energy from footsteps into usable electrical energy, contributing to sustainable development and energy accessibility.

### **Objective**  
- Generate clean, renewable energy by integrating piezoelectric panels into existing urban infrastructure.  
- Reduce dependency on non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels.  
- Explore innovative applications of piezoelectric technology in urban areas.  

---

### **Scope**  
- Investigate the efficiency of piezoelectric technology in generating electricity passively from foot traffic.  
- Measure the power generated by individual footsteps and scale the design for real-world implementation to offset streetlight energy consumption.  
- Assess cost-effectiveness and practicality of scaling the solution.  

---

### **Key Results**  
- **Efficiency**: Achieved a conversion efficiency of **65.85%** in generating electricity from footsteps.  
- **Power Output**: Generated up to **261.2 mW** from 100 footsteps on the designed panel.  
- **Future Work**: Proposed applications include environmental sensors, urban energy systems, and piezoelectric-enhanced daily-use items.
